# COSC-4368 Fundamentals of AI — Final Project: COVID‑19 Classification

This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook, `covid19_classification.ipynb`, implementing a COVID‑19 classification workflow. It is designed for the University of Houston course COSC‑4368: Fundamentals of AI.

## Overview
Briefly describe the project in 2–4 sentences.

- Task: COVID‑19 classification (e.g., from chest X‑rays or clinical/tabular features)
- Motivation: Why this problem matters
- Outcome: What the notebook trains/evaluates and key results

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.9+ (3.10/3.11 recommended)
- pip (or conda)
- JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook

Setup:
```bash
# 1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leo2971998/COSC-4368-Fundamentals-of-AI_FinalProject.git
cd COSC-4368-Fundamentals-of-AI_FinalProject

# 2) (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3) Install dependencies
# If requirements.txt exists:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Otherwise install a common stack used in the notebook (adjust as needed):
pip install jupyter jupyterlab numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
# If the notebook uses deep learning, also install one of:
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# pip install tensorflow
```

## Running the Notebook
```bash
# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```
Then open `covid19_classification.ipynb` and run the cells top to bottom.

Tips:
- Verify data paths in the notebook match your local layout (see Data section).
- If the notebook saves models/plots, ensure the target folders exist (e.g., `models/`, `assets/`).

## Data
Document how to obtain and prepare data.

- Dataset: TODO (name and citation)
- Download/Access: TODO (link or instructions)
- Preprocessing: TODO (splits, cleaning, resizing, normalization)
- Expected structure (example):
```
data/
  raw/         # original downloads
  processed/   # cleaned/split data ready for training
```
Note: Large datasets should not be committed. Use `.gitignore` or external storage.

## Results
Summarize key findings and metrics produced by the notebook.

- Headline metric(s): TODO (e.g., accuracy/F1/ROC‑AUC)
- Plots/Artifacts: Save figures to `assets/` and reference them here:
![Example Figure](assets/example.png)

## Reproducibility
- Random seeds: TODO (e.g., numpy, torch)
- Environment: List versions (Python and key libraries)
- How to reproduce:
  1. Obtain data and place under `data/`
  2. Adjust paths in `covid19_classification.ipynb` as needed
  3. Run all cells to train/evaluate
  4. (Optional) Export results/figures
